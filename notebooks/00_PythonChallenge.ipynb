    "text = \"\"\"Different divisors can be used in place of, or in addition to, 3 and 5, and different words or gestures can replace \"fizz\" or \"buzz\". For example, in Australia a variant based on the game of cricket is played. In this variant, the special numbers are 4 and 6, which are replaced with the cricket umpiring gestures for their respective scoring plays. A common version of the game is also called \"7 Boom\". The players replace every number divisible by 7 or containing the digit 7 with \"boom\".[citation needed]\n",
